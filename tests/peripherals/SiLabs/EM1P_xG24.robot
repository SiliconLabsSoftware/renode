EM1P coverage for the xG24 EMU and its radio sequencer. The xG26 shares the same models
and register map, so the suite also runs on it by overriding PLATFORM_FILE:
renode-test --variable PLATFORM_FILE:platforms/boards/silabs/brd4116a.repl EM1P_xG24.robot

EM1P is the energy mode where the host is in deep sleep but an EM1P requester keeps the
PD1 domain powered. On xG24 the requester is the radio: RAC EM1PCSR reports a request while
the sequencer is running, or while software has taken EM1P control, and the request drops
once the sequencer is in WFI with the radio state machine idle. The sequencer's own WFI
must not select the system energy mode, because that core sleeps with SLEEPDEEP clear.
EM2 shuts the sequencer down: it is held in CPUWAIT and reset, and it stays there until
software sets CPUWAITDIS again.

Host clocks are two gates. The Host EM1P domain (bus, LDMA, GPIO, EUSART0, ...) runs in EM0
and EM1, stops in EM2 with PD1, and in EM1P stops unless RAC EM1PCSR.MCUEM1PMODE is in
software control with MCUEM1PDISSWREQ clear. The HostAll domain is the whole HCLK tree and
holds the general-purpose timers, USART and SysTick. It runs in EM0 and EM1 only, so those
stay stopped in EM1P even when MCUEM1PMODE turns the Host EM1P domain on.
The watchdog has no EM1P run bit: in EM1P it follows EM2RUN, the same as in EM2.

Besides the radio, EUSART0 is an EM1P requester. With RXDMAWU or TXDMAWU set it asks for
EM1P, and for the bus clock, while a DMA request is pending, so the LDMA can move the data
while the host stays in deep sleep. The LDMA is a bus master on the Host EM1P domain: it
holds a request while that domain is gated and runs it once the clocks start.

The host executes a real "wfi" out of SRAM. IRQ0 is enabled up front and pended to leave
the energy mode; its handler is a short counting loop so the core stays awake there
instead of running off the end of the image. A branch to itself is not usable for that,
because this CPU model reports one as WFI.
